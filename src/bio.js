        High energy, self-starter, tenaciously positive + upbeat, and I love coding. "But you didn't study in college!" (this comes up quite often) Partially true. I did study, just didn't major in Computer Science (though I did start a Master's Degree). My education has come through several sources: Harvard and MIT's online Open CourseWare, the nation's highest awarded and most prestigious coding-bootcamp (3% acceptance rate, ranked #1), sifting through online documentation, and my father. Because of him, I have been writing software since I was able to grasp the concepts required. Thankfully it clicked, and I have enjoyed development ever since â€” be it working professionally or simply pursuing hobby projects. Programming is a passion of mine, and I take great pride in my work. I get excited when tasked with producing high caliber bug free code at a quick pace, and take great satisfaction in designing and building out products which users enjoy and which provide business value.
